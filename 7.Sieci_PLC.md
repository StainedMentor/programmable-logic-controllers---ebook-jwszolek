# Driver networks 

## Standard serial links 

### RS-232 (EIA-232, TIA-232) 

One of the earliest established communication standards is the RS-232 (RS meaning Recommended Standard) which was introduced by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) in 1962. It has been revised and renamed multiple times, and is currently designated the name "TIA-232", although it is commonly known as "RS-232C" from the 1969 revision. It is still a commonly used for communication in PLCs.

Data transmission takes place over a single-end link, bit by bit, over a distance of up to approximately 15 meters at a speed up to 20 Kb/s.

The transmitter is a voltage source must not exceed 25V and should be resistant to short circuits to ground, pushing or pulling no more than 0.5A of current. 

On data lines, voltage between -15V to -3V with respect to the Common Ground pin is interpreted as a logic 1. Similarly, voltages between +3V to +15V are a logical 0. The reverse logic applies to control lines. 

Voltages beween -3V and +3V are not valid RS-232 levels. Any transition through this region must not last more than 1ms, and moreover, cannot be longer than 3% of the transmitted bits duration. 

### RS-422 (EIA-422, TIA-422) 

Aonther technical standard originated by EIA, first issued in 1975, with the distinction that the transmission circuits use differential (and balanced) signaling.  

The communication is accomplished by a differential transmitter, a two-wire balanced transmission path and a receiver with a differential input. RS-422 systems can transmit data at rates as high as 10 Mb/s, or may be sent on cables as long as 1.2km at lower rates. The transmission speed limit is the result of the limitations imposed in the standard on the signal's rate of change and bit duration. 

The transmitter has a output circuit with a differential voltage ranging from 2V to 6V at resistance of up to 100 ohms. The short-circuit current of this source must not exceed 150mA. 

The receiver must have an input impedance of at least 4 kiloohms, as up to 10 receivers can be used on a single line. It is specified that is must not be damaged when the power is switched off or switched on under conditions when a short circuit occurs on the line or to the ground.

Actual transmission of bits occurs by changing the polarity of the voltage sent down the wire, with positive voltages from +200mV to +6V representing a logical "0", and negative voltages in the same range - a logical "1". The range of -200mV to 200mV is an undefined state, similarly to RS-232.

### RS-485 (EIA-485, TIA-485) 

Its standard was originally introduced in 1983. Electrical signaling is also balanced, however multipoint systems are also supported (They can include multiple transmitters and receivers). To facilitate this line impedance matching is provided by two 60 ohm resistors placed at the beginning and the end of a line.

It is generally accepted that RS-485 can be used with data rates up to 10 Mb/s or, at lower speeds, distances up to 1.2km. As a rule of thumb, the speed in bit/s multiplied by the length in meters should not exceed 108. Thus a 50-meter cable should not signal faster than 2 Mb/s. 

The transmitter has a differential output circuit with differential voltage range of -1.5V to 5V and a resistance of not more than 60 ohms. The short-circuit current must not exceed 150mA. In contrast to RS-422 (which has a driver circuit that cannot be switched off), RS-485 drivers use three-state logic allowing individual transmitters to be deactivated. Collision detection is used to ensure only one transmitter is active at any time, with other nodes staying in an high impedance mode.

The transmitter can be loaded by a maximum of 32 receivers and 2 impedance matching resistors. A load can consume a maximimum of 1mA at a common voltage of 12V, however there cannot be any additional resistors. 

The receiver must have an input impedance of more than 12 kilohms and a differential input threshold voltage, in the range of 200mV to 5V for common voltages from -7V to 12V.

## Types of data transmission 

Data transmission in the links described above is divided into asynchronous and synchronous transmission. 

In synchronous transmission, a clocking pulse signal is used to time the exchange of information. Data is usually "clocked-in" by a falling or rising edge of the timing signal, giving the transmitter time to settle its output.

*Example of synchronous transmission*

Asynchronous transmission involves transmitting individual characters, which are bookmarked by start and (optionally) end bits. It doesn't use an additional clock line, saving on the amount of pins used, however at a cost of each end-point requring an internal timing generator. As such an incorrectly set oscillator, or an inaccurate one can produce errors in the transmission of data.

*Example of asynchronous transmission*

These are physical layer tasks. At the data linking layer, the task of communication is to establish and abandon communication links, transfer data, and detect errors. This is done using communication protocols such as: 
- MODBUS
- PROFIBUS
- M-Bus
- S-Bus
- BACnet 

## Network topologies 

A computer network topology is a model of the connection arrangement of various elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a computer network. The term network topology can refer to the physical or logical construction of the network. 

In the case of such connections, a local area network (LAN) is created, which can have a diverse network structure (topology).

*Hierarchical topology* 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wY2SMzJ.png)

*Mesh topology* 

The most common are star, loop and ring topologies. 

In a star structure, the central point is the hub, which has a separate link to each network element. Even the usual RS 232 interface can be used in such a network. 

In a ring network, all elements are equal, and a network controller is not required. The data is usually transmitted in only one direction, which simplifies the topology, however a single cable or point failure has the potential to disrupt the entire network.

In serial or bus networks, the earliest rule was used to exchange data packets in the network using the master-slave method, which authorizes only the element of the network with the master-title to initiate transmission. Such a network also uses broadcast transmissions, in which messages are sent simultaneously to all subscribers. 

In a bus network, data can also be exchanged by delegating access to the network. It consists in the fact that we assign a token to subsequent elements of the network that provides access to the network and the ability to transfer our own data (global variables) to other participants of data exchange in this network. 

## Characteristics of selected networks 

### Modbus 

Modbus is a communication protocol developed by Modicon. It is used to communicate with programmable controllers of this company, as well as other manufacturers. It allows you to manage the network of devices such as the temperature and humidity control system. Versions for the serial port and for IP networks were created. IP networks use TCP on port 502.  

Modbus is a Client-Server protocol based on master-slave transaction. Modbus is now an open standard, which has contributed to the widespread standard. Initially, it operated through the RS-232 serial port, but with the development of the protocol, it was possible to use RS-485, which allowed to increase the transmission speed. 

Modbus has 247 child nodes and each of them has a designated response time. When this time is exceeded, the master starts handling the error procedure.

### Profibus 

Real-time industrial network standard. There can be up to 127 drivers in the network. The extent of the network depends on the transmission medium used. Profibus can operate at the transmission speeds from 9600 bit/s to 12000 kbit/s. ProfiBus is a deterministic network. Communication can be broadcast master/slave or master/master. 

The Profibus FMS standard uses the services of platform 2 and 7 of the ISO/OSI models. Layer 2 provides compatibility at the level of acknowledgment and unacknowledged broadcast telegrams. Level 7 provides the standard level. A driver for sharing standard series, strings, arrays, records by specifying their common. Other drivers may write or write these variables in legal devices. It is also possible to control tools on the control (steer, hold, restart, etc.). In addition, ProfibusDP. It is a transmission for very fast operation of decentralized I/O devices. The controller polls the local I/O drivers all the time. 

It is commonly used in Europe. Transmission is compatible with RS485. 

Profibus is a bus topology with master and slave nodes. It works with marker and has data link layer with or without the key.

## Other types of networks 

### Controller Area Network (CAN)  

It is a serial communication bus was created in the 1980s by Robert Bosch GmbH for applications in the automotive industry (ABS, engine control), although it is also used in other areas such as construction[1] . Currently, it is also used in industrial field buses (most popular standards: CANopen, DeviceNet, SDS). 
- Used in automotive technology and automation.
- Bus links.
- CSMA/CA link. 

### Sercos
- Used to control the movement of machine tool drives.
- Ring link with fiber optic line.
- Collision-free communication through the use of a time-slot mechanism.
- Highly efficient communication protocol (little overhead).
- Extremely low telegram jitter (specified at less than 1 microsecond, in practice as low as 35 nanoseconds).
- Highly developed standardized profiles agreed upon by multi-vendor technical working groups for dependable interoperability of devices from different manufacturers.
- Ability to control, for example, 60 axes of motion at an update of 250 microseconds for each and every drive (Sercos III).

### EtherCAT
- special type of industrial network designed for automation
- innovative solution introduced in the EtherCAT protocol, there is a system for distributing the clock signal from the master to the devices slave, thanks to which it is possible to synchronize with an accuracy of up to 1 millisecond of servo operation or other devices
- another solution used in the EtherCAT protocol is the introduction of system-wide telegrams consisting of datagrams assigned to logical tasks, as shown in the figure. Thanks to this, maximum use of each transmission packet was obtained with minimal delay (90% process data and only 10% control data), which is required in RTOS (Real Time Operating Systems).

- EtherCAT is based on the physical layer of the Ethernet network, drawing from it all the advantages of this network: simple wiring and easy connection without unnecessary terminators, possibly long sections between stations up to 100 m, which allows for the construction of extensive and distributed systems, high transmission speed, low cost, scalability.
- the EtherCAT protocol is TÜV certified, standardized to IEC 61784-3 and suitable for safety applications up to SIL3, so SAFETY modules can be interconnected using it


### Interbus 

INTERBUS is a serial bus system which transmits data between control systems and spatially distributed I/O modules that are connected to sensors and actuators. 

At the moment, more than 600 manufacturers are involved in the implementation of INTERBUS technology in control systems and field devices. 

Since 2011 is the INTERBUS technology hosted by the industry association Profibus and Profinet International. 

## Industrial networks 

The most popular industrial network is Ethernet.  

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/74e6FYU.png)

The current decade has undoubtedly seen an increase in the use of Ethernet networks in industry as well as the popularization of Ethernet as a standard connecting machines and production halls with the IT infrastructure of industrial enterprises. These types of networks are used today for communication between industrial computers, HMI, controllers, and even actuators and drives. 

Ethernet is characterized by:
- Scalability.
- Security.
- Relatively low infrastructure costs.
- Possibility of easy integration with traditional IT systems. 

At the same time, the industry has developed a number of standards that allow for real-time operation, which is necessary in controlling the operation of machines that require synchronization of axis operation and robot control. 

According to HMS, Ethernet accounted for 52% of the global market compared to 46% a year earlier. The most popular such network is currently EtherNet/IP (15% market share). PROFINET, EtherCAT, Modbus-TCP and Ethernet POWERLINK. The growth rate of industrial Ethernet applications is 22%. 

The above statistics do not mean that field nets are in retreat! Yes, there are changes and the use of specific network solutions is changing, but the popularity of fieldbus networks is constantly increasing, which is due to, among others, cyber security issues.
