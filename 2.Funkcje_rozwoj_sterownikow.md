## 1. PLC internal structure

#### Two basic concepts in PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) construction are:
- Block Construction (Compact): 
  - Typically used for small controllers (up to 256 inputs/outputs)
  - Contains a complete controller module including:
    - Power supply
    - Central processing unit (CPU)
    - Input and output modules with fixed number of terminals
  - Simple design
  - Easy installation
- Panel Construction (Modular):
  - Can be used for controllers of all sizes, but it is more common for medium-sized controllers (up to 1024 inputs/outputs) and large controllers (above 1024 inputs/outputs)
  - Individual functional modules such as:
      - Power supply
      - CPU
      - Input and output modules
  - Are placed in separate panels
  - Users configure the controller's structure by selecting and placing panels in the enclosure
  - Expanding modules containing additional input and output circuits utilize the memory and power supply in the central unit
 
### PLC consists of the following components:
- central processing unit
- memory
- input module
- output module
- power supply unit

### Central processing unit

The main component of any PLC. It is responsible for the operation of the controller, proper operation of expansion modules, execution of the program and communication with the programmer.
The most important component of the central unit is the microprocessor, whose parameters dictate the capabilities of the controller itself and its specification e.g.:

- number of input and output variables
- the maximum number of expansion modules supported
- the speed of the controller - the parameter determining this value is expressed as the time of the program cycle, e.g. as the number of executed instructions per time unit.
- the size of the memory allocated for user data and for the program
- possibility of using special functions, which include floating point operations
- communication capabilities, e.g. support for LAN functions

### Memory
Memory is an indispensable component for the operation of the CPU within a PLC, serving as a digital storage medium that holds both the control program, comprising a series of instructions governing the PLC's behavior, and user data, which encompasses variables, timers, counters, and other essential information crucial for executing the control program effectively.

#### Applied types of memory 
- RAM - Random Access Memory - used as operational memory, it is characterized by high read and write speeds. When the power is disconnected, it loses all stored data. For this reason, an additional battery is used to replace the power supply when it is missing or turned off.
- PROM - Programmable Read-Only Memory - its overwriting involves burning through the connectors inside the memory. Resistor arrays and transistor arrays are used. In the former, resistors are burned to open, which means programming a logic zero. Transistors, on the other hand, are burned into a short circuit, which is equivalent to programming a logical one.
- EEPROM - Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory - programmable read-only memory that is programmed and erased electrically. Unlike PROM-type memory, it can also be overwritten. It does not require a power supply like RAM type memory. Used as program memory but also as backup storage.
- FLASH EPROM - Flash Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory - a type of memory that is a development of EEPROM technology. Used where EEPROM, but also as a storage medium for copies of data that can be transferred between controllers, for example, in the form of SD cards.

### Input modules
They are divided into digital and analog types. The former take data in binary form (1/0), and the second in the form of continuous signals, e.g. temperature value, weight, tilt. 

#### Digital inputs
They are a key part of the communication interface between the components of the external control system and the CPU. They are responsible for converting variable or continuous signals from external devices into digital signals understood by the CPU.
One encounters DC-powered modules, where most often the logic zero corresponds to 0V and the logic one to 24V, and AC-powered ones, which adjust the logic level to the voltage value of the power grid.
It is common to find the use of galvanic separation (i.e., a solution in which the current from one electrical block does not flow directly to another block) between external circuits and the main bus of the PLC. For this purpose, transporters are used for direct current and optoisolators for alternating current.

#### Analog inputs
Their task is to translate received analog signals into digital versions, understood by the central unit. The main component of this module is an analog-to-digital converter, which passes on the discrete form of the received input signal. It performs quantization most often on 16 bits. Common resolutions of such a converter are from 12 to 16 bits.
Many analog signals are used. Here are some examples:
- ###### voltage signals e.g. 0 - 10V, 1 - 5V, -10 - +10V
- ###### current signals e.g. 0 - 20mA, 4 - 20mA
- ###### resistance measurement signal

### Output modules
Similar to inputs, they are divided according to the type of data that can be obtained from them - digital and analog. They are used to control automation executive devices, e.g. contacts, regulators, solenoid valves, control systems.

#### Digital outputs
They are used to output signals in discrete form to external circuits of executive devices. Most often they are connected to switches or contactors, which are responsible for the operation of external devices/modules.
We distinguish two groups of digital outputs due to the type of output control element:

- ###### Relay outputs
They have outputs for normally open and closed relay contacts, the purpose of which is to switch on and off external electrical systems.

- ###### Solid-state outputs
Instead of contacts, they use transistors for DC systems and thyristors or triacs for AC systems. They perform the same function as relays, but have a significant advantage over them in terms of speed of operation and durability, as well as making no noise during operation.

#### Analog outputs
Their task is to convert numerical values stored in memory into signals that are continuous in time. Further, like digital outputs, they transmit signals to external devices.
The most important component of this module is the digital-to-analog converter. At its output appears current or voltage signals. The most common are those listed in the analog inputs chapter. Common resolutions of such a converter are from 12 to 16 bits.

### Communication module
The communication module is designed to connect other devices to the controller by exchanging data between them. An industrial communication network is used for such communication.
Examples of devices with which the controller can communicate:
- other PLCs, including those operating in redundant mode,
- sensors and measurement transducers, smart sensors,
- executive devices equipped with their own communication interfaces,
- master control systems,
- HMI (Human-Machine Interface) device, e.g. control panels, displays, information LEDs

### Power module
The component responsible for providing the energy necessary for the operation of the controller. It can be a separate part, but also can be found power supplies integrated into the housing of the controller. In general, systems adapted to 24V DC power supply are used, but there are also designs that can supply the controller directly from the power grid with AC voltage of 230V or 110V (this depends on the power system of the country).
Pulse power supplies are often used as a power supply, which are characterized by the following features:
- high output voltage stabilization
- high efficiency of the converter of AC voltage to DC voltage
- high power in relation to small dimensions
- built-in protection against overvoltage and overload
- compliance with many standards, allowing operations in harsh environments as well as electromagnetic compatibility

The power supplies used in the controllers are often dedicated to the designed structures, what makes them quite expensive.

## 2. Working principle of the controller

Each PLC works by continuously looping a sequence of commands stored in its memory, called a cycle.
A single instruction is the smallest part of the control program and consists of an operation specifying the type of function to be performed and arguments specifying input and output signals of the controller connected with each other by logical functions. These commands are processed by the controller's microprocessor system, which, on their basis, performs appropriate actions, such as: logical operations, arithmetic operations, reading and writing data from/to memory.
Execution of part of the phases of the cycle depends on the operating mode of the controller. The basic operating modes are:
- RUN - the correct operating mode of the controller, in which all phases of the program cycle are performed. The user cannot modify the content of the program during it.
- STOP – controller stopping mode, in which data reading and writing are usually omitted and the program execution phase is always omitted. This mode is intended for programming and configuring the controller. The user can control the controller outputs by forcing appropriate logical states.
- MONITOR – controller operating mode with the possibility of viewing its memory. It allows the user to check the correct operation of his application by viewing the values of characteristic process variables and the ability to force logical states on the controller's outputs. It is also possible to edit most areas of the controller's memory (changing the values of timers, counters, I/O memory, etc.). The MONITOR mode is especially useful in the commissioning phase of the control system.

Special modes designed for testing:
- work in a single cycle (Single Sweep),
- step operation (execution of only one command)
- work with normal cycle, but without activation of output signals in
digital output modules (test mode).

The program cycle usually lasts from fractions to tens of ms. If the allowed cycle time is exceeded (usually 100 to 500 ms), the cycle is aborted and a cycle timeout error is logged. Cycle lengths are constantly monitored by the clock system in the CPU, the so-called [watchdog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer).

### Phases of the controllers work cycle

##### 1. Controller Initilization
##### 2. Input Data Reading
##### 3. Execution of Controllers Task
##### 4. Output Data Writing
##### 5. Communications Handling
##### 6. Self-diagnosis

### 1. Controller Initilization
At this stage controller performs necessary actions to start working, including checking functionality of internal circuits, configurating the hardware of components and expansion modules. Unlike other stages which repeat with each work cycle, this is executed only once.

### 2. Input Data Reading
During the phase of input data reading in a controller's work cycle, the controller systematically examines the current status of all connected input devices, collecting information about their states. This data is then stored in a specialized memory region known as the Process-Image Input (PII). Importantly, this process of reading input states occurs just once within each cycle, which signifies that any modifications or alterations made to the input conditions while the controller's tasks are being executed will not take immediate effect but will instead be applied during the subsequent cycle. This sequencing ensures that the control program operates on a consistent and unchanging set of input data throughout its execution, maintaining a reliable and predictable basis for decision-making and control actions.

### 3.  Execution of Controllers Task
In this phase users program is processed. Based on its instructions specific actions are being executed. All commands are executed in a sequence, one after the other. This prevents execution of two actions at the same time. Calculation results are also stored in data memory. After executing all commands a new state of outputs is generated that is stored in a specific memory location called the Process-Image Output (PIO).

Program execution takes a certain time that dependents on the parameters and the program’s length (from a few to several hundred milliseconds). In the worst case scenario the delay introduced by the controller can reach up to 2 controller’s cycles.

Attention should be paid to assigning values to output variables. Each variable should be assigned a value only once, because last assignment statement will override previous values.

### 4. Saving the controller output data
During the process of saving the controller output data, the values representing the status of the outputs stored in the Process-Image Output (PIO) memory are transferred and written to the physical output ports of the device. These updates are precisely aligned with the values calculated by the control program based on the current input conditions and logic. Notably, this update operation is a singular event that takes place just once during each work cycle, ensuring that the output devices respond consistently and coherently to the control program's directives.

### 5. Communication support
This phase occurs only when network communication with other external devices is used, e.g. other controllers, operator panels.
There is a two-way data transmission and programmer support, e.g. a computer transmitting control commands, such as switching the operating mode, reading/writing the program.

### 6. Self-diagnosis
The controller performs self-diagnostic tests to monitor its status and detect possible failures. It checks, among other things:
- component temperature
- system supply voltage
- CPU load
- appearance of logical errors during the execution of the program
- communication interfaces, input/output modules and memory

When problems are detected, the controller reports an error to the user or supervisory system through messages or LEDs. It then takes corrective action, such as an immediate stop to prevent uncontrolled activation of actuators, or a fallback mode where it makes limited decisions. Otherwise controller loops back to phase 2. Input Data Reading.

## 3. Writing and reading of data

##### The chapters above list the types of memory that the PLC uses.
- RAM - Random Access Memory - RAM memory is responsible for storing data and programs. This memory is used for reading and writing user data or programs. In practice, this means that every new program or its new section is saved in RAM. All changes made by the programmer to the program or data will be automatically overwritten in the memory. Input/Output values are also stored in the RAM section.
  Please note that all data stored in RAM will be lost when the power is turned off (if RAM does not have an auxiliary power source).
- ROM - Read Only Memory - is used only for reading data. It stores information such as: operating system, software version and variables defined by the system (these are also saved in the EEPROM).

PLC controllers also have a cache memory, just like computers or laptops. The cache can store periodic tasks and events or system and program usage data. The big advantage of cache memory is the speed of data saving - it can be even several times faster than RAM memory.

The controllers have a limited amount of memory, so before programming it is important to read its parameters, which can be found in the "Datasheet" of a given controller.
An additional difficulty will be the lack of a standard that would be responsible for standardizing where the individual memory locations in which we will save data are located. Memory maps differ not only between different manufacturers, but also within individual devices of a given manufacturer.

In the controllers memory, digital inputs and outputs correspond to single bits, while analog inputs and outputs correspond to multi-bit records.
An additional advantage of PLC controllers is the ability to connect them to the Internet, which allows programming, diagnostics, downloading and sending data wirelessly.

## 4. Application areas, advantages and disadvantages

##### The main advantage of PLCs is to facilitate repetitive activities, e.g. in controlling traffic lights, elevators or escalators.

The application area of drivers is very wide. Due to their functionality, they can be found in such areas as:
- industrial automation (controlling entire production lines),
- transport,
- chemical and pharmaceutical industries,
- energetics,
- building automation and everyday use devices (control of smart homes, security, air conditioning, monitoring, lighting),
- warehouse logistics (sorting, folding, stacking),
- agricultural industry (field irrigation).

#### Advantages:

- comparing the PLC controller with systems based on relay systems, the change of the operation algorithm does not require any changes in the installation,
- simple assembly significantly shortens the duration of installation,
- lower implementation costs, which means that all projects can be implemented in a shorter time,
- in case of a failure remote diagnostics are possible, they can be carried out from anywhere in the world
- low power consumption and high reliability,
- possibility of connecting an expansion modules and integration with other automation elements,
- designed to resist vibration, temperature and humidity,
- portable size,
- easy programming, relatively easy programming languages,
- much cheaper than industrial computers.

#### Disadvantages:

- low flexibility compared to the capabilities of industrial computers, which are able to perform many more tasks related to control, measurement as well as communication and data transmission,
- cable management requires a lot of work,
- finding a bug is difficult and requires specialist knowledge,
- limiting the work of controllers in too high temperatures and too strong vibrations (because they are made of semiconductors),
- in some cases, even small projects can be expensive.

## 5. Development of controllers

#### Controller's capabilities and grow each year and their increased functionality makes working with them easier:

- With the ability to connect to the Internet, PLCs have gained the ability to download and send data through network. Nowadays, a great convenience is the ability to program controllers via a browser, which does not require a powerful computer or specialized programs,
- Connection to the Internet allows implementation of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), simplifying transfer of data between modules. This is useful for connecting multiple workstations (posibbly in different factories) together, or for extracting production data.
- Multiple protocols - facilitating data exchange - easier communication between automation components,
- Miniaturization - smaller size of controllers without loss of performance or functionality,
- New libraries and functions - dedicated libraries and functions allow complex operations to be implemented very easily. They make it possible to control speeds, positions or moments,
- Modular design allows not only easy replacement of damaged components, but also easy customization of the hardware configuration and the possibility of future expansion.
- While more generalized computing hardware is often available, PLCs being smaller, cheaper and more durable makes them irreplaceable in many industrial applications.

#### PLC development historical background

The first programmable controller was created in 1968 by a group of engineers from General Motors. Their task was to design a new generation of universal controllers that could operate in an industrial environment. The project was based on the following assumptions:
- ease of programming and reprogramming depending on changing industrial conditions,
- smaller dimensions and greater reliability compared to relay installations,
- lower installation costs compared to relay control cabinets,
- modular construction, ensuring easy repair by replacing damaged modules,
- easy maintenance in production.

Work on the first programmable controller was carried out in the United States simultaneously by several companies. The first programmable controller, Modicon 084, was built in 1969. It was an impressive technical achievement as the controller had a program memory of 4kB and weighed 46kg.
Initially, the automotive industry, which was rapidly developing at the time, was the main recipient of programmable controllers. However, already in the early 1970s, PLCs gained enormous popularity in industry.

In the 1970s, PLCs gradually replaced relay control systems and sequential control devices that used mechanical drum and cam systems. In the mid-1970s, distributed input-output modules were introduced into production, which enabled remote control from a distance of several hundred meters from the main control station using wired communication networks.

In the 1980s, so-called intelligent expansion modules were introduced, which had their own processors and enabled the implementation of complex computing functions.

In the 1990s, programmable controllers almost completely replaced relay control systems and analog industrial control regulators. The increasing popularity of computers and software development allowed for the development of communication capabilities of controllers and their integration with computer data exchange and analysis systems. The first supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems were created, which significantly expanded the capabilities of the then-existing control systems by providing controlled flow of process data between individual layers of the control system.

In the last decade, especially in the process automation industry (chemical, food, pharmaceutical), there has been an increasing trend of replacing traditional, centralized control systems with distributed DCS systems (Distributed Control System). DCS systems contain basic automation elements (programmable controllers, industrial communication networks, visualization systems) and at the same time form an integral whole, as they have a common database of process variables used for both control and visualization. In DCS systems, fast and advanced PLC controllers working under the control of a real-time operating system are commonly used to supervise deterministic execution of all process tasks and can handle even several thousand process variables.
